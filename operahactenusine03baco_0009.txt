NOTE

T HE completion of the first book of the Communia ll'olnrolz'zcm
perniits us to consider its relationship to three other works of Bacmi,
the Opus Terlz'nm (Β), the first treatise in B.M. 8786 (S)-which is
the first part of the Compendinm Philosophie, Des. I V-and that in
Digby 190, the ‘ de principiis nalure' (P).

S and P were undoubtedly written before any part of the Com—
mum'a Naturalmm was in existence. They both contain much that is
not included in it, and show, in those parts that cover the same ground,
earlier forms of the argument and different conclusions. S seems the
earlier, it coincides with M in pp. 54—9‚ 69—75, 78-86, and 239-67
of this edition, going on with other matter, and finishing with pp. 142—
98 of the Opus Ibrtz'um (Brewer). P begins at p. 50, l. 1 1, and goes
on generally to pp. 59, 66-9‚ 74, 75, 78-86, and 239-67, where it
stops. It will be remembered that some of these passages occur only
in M, not in F or D. Yet the note in D (p. 57, l. 3) refers to P, and
that to l. 7 quoted from F to a MS. of the S type. The passages
common to the Opus Drlz'um and the Communia Naturalzmn are
pp. 173—9 (189—97 Brewer), 225—39 (168-84 Brewer) and some
part which has yet to be determined of pp. 275-308. Of these the
second and the third were plainly written for the Opus Tertium, and
afterwards incorporated in the Communia Alzlztralium. The first, Ι
incline to believe, had a common source in S.

It has been pointed out in the notes of the first part that the
Communia Nolnrolz'um, or some part of it, was written before the
Opus sllajus, and that it was subsequently revised ; the two editions
being represented by F and M. F is much nearer to S and P in the
common passages than M. F itself was evidently corrected early in
the sourteenth century (say 1320) and pp. 224-39 inserted, the
insertion being a little longer than the passage borrowed from the
Opus Tertium. A very remarkable fact in the history of M (which
dates from the middle of the fifteenth century) is that the copyist, after
transcribing the chapters on pp. 92-107 from some source at present
unknown to us, went on with ‘Pars quarta Communium Naturalium.

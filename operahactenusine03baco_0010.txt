iv

Hiis habitis de parte materie . . .' instead of ⁴ Distinccio quarta’ &c.
Having finished the leaf he found out his mistake, marked it for
erasure, and began again correctly. This form is not that with which
the fourth part does begin, but it is found in S and P. It would
almost seem as if the present form of this fourth part were due to
a late editor. It is to be hoped that some happy chance may disclose
another MS. which will throw light on the question.

l may be allowed, while disagreeing entirely with M. Duhem's
proposed reconstruction of the Opus Tertium, to add a tribute to the
insight, amounting to genius, which discovered the important fragment
he has given to the world, and to point out that it also includes the
‘tractatus alkimisticus ’ sent with boy John to the pope—(pp. 181—90‚
Duhem‚ Opus T erlz'um)—a work of the first importance for the under—
standing of mediaeval alchemy. Ι desire to renew my expression of
thanks to those who have helped in the preparation of this edition.
